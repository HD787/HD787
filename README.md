My name is Henry Derrick and I love all things computers.

I went to School at SUNY Plattsburgh for computer Science and Graduated in 2022.

I do a lot of things, unfortunately I keep most of my repositories on private except for some older ones, however if you are interested in seeing my work please let me know as I am excited to share it.

Lately I've been working as a freelance developer.


My Current project is a suite of business applications for a company. Using the .NET framework, specifically a newer one called .NET Maui which is based off of xamarin, ive made a desktop app and a mobile app designed to assist with various parts of business administration. 

the mobile app is designed for employee use to in the area of timetracking, its fairly simple, it allows employees to submit their own hours, review their previous shifts and view aggregate data to see where they've been spending their time.

The Desktop app is to be used by management, all of the employees submitted hours end up here, they can be approved or denied by the management, this system give the management access to aggregate data and provides useful functionality such as bill generation, spreadsheet generation, helpful payroll information, job tracking information, as well as API integration (specifically Quickbooks at this time).

everything is connected through a server backend, spun up on a linux vm somewhere in the google cloud is a postgres database that allows both apps to share data.


Ive also been practicing some web development, this takes the form of my website, henryderrick.com, there's not a whole lot going on here however I thought it would be important to learn some stuff about the world of web, as such I took a really traditonal approach to this, only using JavaScript, HTML, CSS and PHP as a backend. Again I have all this sitting on a linux vm somewhere in the google cloud where I have implemented a LAMP stack (full disclosure I didnt use MySQL because I couldn't find a reason to, I do plan on changing this but for now I guess it's really just a LAP stack).


I am currently looking to find employment as I am interested in being part of a team and larger projects is exciting to me. High level application development is what I have most experience in, but I would love to explore the world of systems programming and firmware.

I've really been pouring my time into higher level business solutions and app development, I do thoroughly enjoy this but I am trying to expand my horizons, I like to spend my free time learning really low level software, I've been enjoying expanding my C skills, learning rust and assembly languages, lately ive been looking into the x86 and arm64 assemblies as they are the most accessible to me.
